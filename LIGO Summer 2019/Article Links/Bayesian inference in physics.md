## Terminology

<u> Bayesian Inference:</u> describing the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

<u> Bayes' Theorem:</u> P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) 
i.e. "the probability of A given B occurs is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A over B."

<u> Occam's Razor:</u> The problem-solving principle that essentially states that "simpler solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones."

## Abstract

Bayesian principles are used in several systems that are given as example.
