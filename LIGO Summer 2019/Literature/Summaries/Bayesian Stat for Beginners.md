## Terminology

<u> Bayesian Statistics:</u> a particular approach to applying probability to statistical problems. It provides us with tools to update our beliefs about random events in light of seeing new data or evidence about those events.

<u> Classical Statistics:</u> Also known as "<u>Frequentist</u>" statistics, this is the traditional approach to applying probability to statistical problems. It assumes that probabilities are the *frequency* of particular random events occurring in a long run of repeated trials.

## What is Bayesian Statistics?

In a statistical problem, we may have a prior belief about an event, but our beliefs are likely to change when new evidence is brought to light. Bayesian statistics gives us a solid mathematical means of incorporating our *prior* beliefs, and evidence, to produce new *posterior* beliefs.

Bayesian inferences interpret probability as a measure of believability or confidence that an individual may possess about the occurrence of a particular event.

Frequentist statistics tries to eliminate uncertainty by providing estimates. Bayesian statistics tries to preserve and refine uncertainty by adjusting individual beliefs in light of new evidence.

Thus in the Bayesian interpretation a probability is a summary of an individual's opinion. In the Bayesian framework an individual would apply a probability of 0 when they have no confidence in an event occurring, while they would apply a probability of 1 when they are absolutely certain of an event occurring.
