## Terminology

<u> Bayesian Inference:</u> describing the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

## Abstract

Bayesian principles are used in several systems that are given as example.

## Introduction

Bayesian methods are not as useful in fields where active experiments can be repeated in principle in order to satisfy precision requirements.

### Bayesian Principles

Beginning with a probability function P(d,O | I), where d,O are two variables that are conditional on all background information I. This two-variable function can be decomposed into separate one-variable functions in the following steps:

	- P(d,O | I) =  P(O | I) * P(d | O,I) = P(d | I) * P(O | d,I)
