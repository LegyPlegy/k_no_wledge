# bash_scripts

Contains all the useful bash scripts i've made over time, usually serve the purpose as making new commands to improve workflow

all scripts need to be placed in the /home/<usr>/bin (or just ~/bin) directory, and then make sure that that bin directory is added to $PATH

### bash_script_command
`command syntax` \
description of command

### start_jupyter
`start_jupyter <DIR>` \
this script creates a jupyter lab environment in the directory specified by the argument \<DIR>. If \<DIR> is not specified, it takes the default directory to be $HOME/GitHub/

### fix_ideapad_wifi  [no longer necessary in ubuntu 20.04]
'fix_ideapad_wifi' \
this script is a command I need to run every so often or whenever I have a fresh install of linux in order to disable the hard block on wifi. Why? I have no idea. It just works.
